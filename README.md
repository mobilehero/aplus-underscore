## Overview

### Why should I use this plugin?
[alloy-underscore][] is an [Alloy+][] Plugin for fixing invalid usages of underscore.js within Alloy source code.  This paves the way to be able to use newer versions of underscore.js or lodash.

### What is Alloy+?

[Alloy+][] is an entire framework built around [Appcelerator Mobile](http://www.appcelerator.com/mobile-app-development-products/) and their [Alloy](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy) product. 
The idea for this framework was built upon the concepts of [MobileHero Adamantium](https://github.com/mobilehero/adamantium) 
and a desire to customize and extend Appcelerator Alloy for developers.  How much faster or stronger all depends on YOU, the developer.  

There will be an assortment of alloy+ plugins (available as npm modules) that you can install in your project to help you take your existing development tools furthur 
than possible today.  You can choose which modules are executed in your `config.json` file (which is part of your Alloy project).  You can also easily create your own plugins by simply creating a npm module that follows a simple convention.  

## Install
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40mobile%2Falloy-underscore.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobile/alloy-underscore)

> _Install in the root directory of your Appcelerator mobile project (the directory containing `tiapp.xml`)._

```bash
npm install --save @mobile/alloy-underscore
```

## Usage

To use this installed plugin in your app, merge the following to your app's `config.json` file:

```json
  {
      "global": {
            "tasks": {
                  "precompile": [ "alloy-underscore" ]
            }
      }
```


>_Most often, you will probably want to run these in the `precompile` stage of the Alloy build process so that 
any changes done by this plugin can get picked up before copying files over to the build folder._

### Examples

**Fix underscore.js issues in the Platform-specific resource folder**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"precompile": [ "@mobile/alloy-underscore" ]`


## Other Alloy+ Plugins 

> ** Coming Soon! :mega: **

- [`npm`](https://github.com/mobilehero/npm): Execute npm during the Alloy build process
- [`babel`](https://github.com/mobilehero/alloy-babel): Run babel transformations on your code during the build process
- [`es6`](https://github.com/mobilehero/alloy-es6): Use ES6/ES2015 code in your apps via babel transformations!
- [`nodejs`](https://github.com/mobilehero/alloy-nodejs): Make `require` statements in your app support nodejs packages installed via npm
